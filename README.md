# MavenChallenge-PizzaPlaceSales
üçï Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard

As part of my ongoing exploration into data analytics, I took on a project centered on analyzing sales data from a fictitious pizza place, courtesy of Maven Analytics.

Objective: Equip the business owners with insights into:
  + Overall performance
  + Seasonality trends
  + Peak sales hours
  + Best and worst-selling products

Dashboard Breakdown:
  + Performance Over Time: Track the restaurant's growth and sales trends.
  + Peak Hours: Identify the busiest times for the business.
  + Pizza Type Performance: Understand which pizzas are fan-favorites and which aren't hitting the mark.
  + Ingredients Analysis: Gauge the usage and popularity of different ingredients.

Tool Used: Power BI
